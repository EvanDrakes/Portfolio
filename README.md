## Projects
### Data Cleaning
[Cleaning Project](https://evandrakes.github.io/google_sheets_2021_fifa/)

Cleaned a messy data set about the 2021 FIFA game using **Google Sheets/Excel**. I used similar coding to show a better understanding of how to clean and make sure the data is fit and ready to be processed into an overall better use.

### Data Visualization
[Visualization Project](https://public.tableau.com/views/LondonBikeRides_17021447733120/LondonBikeDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Using **Tableau** to create a dashboard on Bike Rides in London, creating an adjustable time frame which includes the total amount of rides, the weather (type of percipitation and wind speeds), and the time of day the rides were taken. 

### Data Organization
[Organization Project](https://evandrakes.github.io/Organization_Project/)

With a larger dataset with upwards of 50,000 entries using **SQL**, I organized four questions and wrote code that would be ready to go straight into the data visualization process. The questions all got answered and cleaned in such way that you could create a nice looking dashboard/graphs to finish the project.
